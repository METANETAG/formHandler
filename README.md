formHandler
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/METANETAG/formHandler.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/METANETAG/formHandler)

This is a library for handling web based forms written in PHP. It takes care about verifying and rendering form components.

Basic requirements of the formHandler library are:

* easy to use - without a lot of knowledge depending on processing forms in PHP.
* efficiency boost - the library should generalize things you have to redo for each and every form and field in it

[See the wiki](http://github.com/METANETAG/formHandler/wiki) for more information about how to use the library.
