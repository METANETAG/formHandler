formHandler
===========
This is a library for handling web based formulars written in PHP. It takes care about verifying and rendering formular components.

Basic requirements of the formHandler library are:

* easy to use - without a lot of knowledge depending on processing formulars in PHP.
* efficiency boost - the library should generalize things you have to redo for each and every form and field in it

[See the wiki](/METANETAG/formHandler/wiki) for more information about how to use the library.
